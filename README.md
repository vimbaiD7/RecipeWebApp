# RecipeWepApp
This document outlines the scope, requirements, and technical specifications for the "User Management and Recipe Dashboard" project. This project is designed to provide Vimbai Danduri, a 2nd-year Computer Science student, with practical experience across various critical areas of software development, including User Interface (UI), User Experience (UX), Application Programming Interface (API) development, and database management using PostgreSQL via Supabase.
The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to sign up, log in, manage their profiles, and create/view their cooking recipes.
